# Detection of Unhealthy Brain Disease using MRI with Artificial Intelligence

In our work, we have not only detected the brain tumor but we also segmented that
where is tumor in the Human Brain. The task of detecting the position of the tumor in the body
of the patient is the starting point for medical treatment. Brain tumor detection in an early stage
can help to reduce the death rate in the medical field. The most common brain tumor is gliomas.
It is categorized as HGG (high-grade glioma) and LGG (low-grade glioma). By the use of MRI,
we get information on gliomas. For sub-regions and details of a tumor, the MRI has the
following sequence such as T1-weighted image, T1-weighted with gadolinium contrast
enhancement (t1gd), T2-weighted image, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery- (FLAIR)
weighted image
## Acknowledgements

 First and foremost, we would like to express our gratitude to the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore (UET) for providing complete project or study materials to make my research easier. As an undergraduate student, the wonderful atmosphere leads to my success. Second, we would like to thank our counsellor, Sir Zain Shabbir, who is also our project supervisor, for his continuous guidance and instruction. Sir Zain Shabbir has shared a lot of his research experience with us, which has inspired us to work on our project. Aside from that, we would like to thank all our colleagues, lecturers, technicians, and Uetians club members who helped make our project a success. It is greatly appreciated that they participated in the project's experimental phase. Finally, and most importantly, we would like to thank our family for all they've done. Throughout our undergraduate studies, they have supported us   in academia. We are thankful for their endless moral support. Their inspiration and encouragement have been at the center of my drive to learn and create
  
## Abstract
Analysis of the 3d volume of brain MRI of the patient is a time taking task for doctors. Deep Learning algorithms help doctors for investing interesting parts timely and then finalize the results more efficiently. Brain tumor segmentation separates the cancerous part of the brain from the normal brain. Brain tumor segmentation is classified into four parts such as preprocessing, segmentation, optimization, and feature extraction.  The importance of MRI-based segmentation expanded in recent years. MRI is the most reliable, safe, and has good resolution. It has no side effects, no radiation, and not harmful to other parts of the body. The tumor is segmented after MRI is processed. In this report, we proposed an automatic segmentation method based on CNN. It includes many layers for feature extraction and brain tumor segmentation. For this, the BraTS 2018 dataset consists of 210 HGG (High-Grade Glioma) images and 75 LGG (Low-Grade Glioma).
