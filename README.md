# Detection of Unhealthy Brain Disease using MRI with Artificial Intelligence

In our work, we have not only detected the brain tumor but we also segmented that
where is tumor in the Human Brain. The task of detecting the position of the tumor in the body
of the patient is the starting point for medical treatment. Brain tumor detection in an early stage
can help to reduce the death rate in the medical field. The most common brain tumor is gliomas.
It is categorized as HGG (high-grade glioma) and LGG (low-grade glioma). By the use of MRI,
we get information on gliomas. For sub-regions and details of a tumor, the MRI has the
following sequence such as T1-weighted image, T1-weighted with gadolinium contrast
enhancement (t1gd), T2-weighted image, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery- (FLAIR)
weighted image
## Acknowledgements

 First and foremost, we would like to express our gratitude to the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore (UET) for providing complete project or study materials to make my research easier. As an undergraduate student, the wonderful atmosphere leads to my success. Second, we would like to thank our counsellor, Sir Zain Shabbir, who is also our project supervisor, for his continuous guidance and instruction. Sir Zain Shabbir has shared a lot of his research experience with us, which has inspired us to work on our project. Aside from that, we would like to thank all our colleagues, lecturers, technicians, and Uetians club members who helped make our project a success. It is greatly appreciated that they participated in the project's experimental phase. Finally, and most importantly, we would like to thank our family for all they've done. Throughout our undergraduate studies, they have supported us   in academia. We are thankful for their endless moral support. Their inspiration and encouragement have been at the center of my drive to learn and create
